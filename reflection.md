## Reflection — Lab 5: Static Code Analysis

1. Which issues were the easiest to fix, and which were the hardest? Why?

- Easiest:
  - Mutable default argument (e.g., `logs=[]`) — changing the default to `None` and initializing inside the function is a small, local change with immediate, predictable effect.
  - Logging format warnings — switching from f-strings to lazy formatting (`logger.info("msg %s", value)`) is mechanical and removes unnecessary interpolation costs.

- Hardest:
  - Choosing the correct exception handling boundaries — replacing overly broad `except:` blocks requires reasoning about which specific exceptions can occur and how the program should behave for each. Narrowing exceptions without breaking program semantics takes a bit more thought and testing.

2. Did the static analysis tools report any false positives? If so, describe one example.

- In this run there were no clear false positives in the code I worked on. The tools reported actionable items (missing docstrings, logging formatting, broad exceptions, mutable defaults). A common false-positive you may see in other projects is Bandit flagging the use of `eval` or `exec` when the input is already sanitized by surrounding code — the tool can’t always infer higher-level context, so those hits sometimes need manual review.

3. How would you integrate static analysis tools into your actual software development workflow?

- Pre-commit hooks: run Flake8 and a subset of Pylint checks locally during commits so style and obvious issues are caught early.
- CI pipeline: add a GitHub Actions job that runs Flake8, Pylint and Bandit on every PR and fails the pipeline for high-severity or score regressions.
- Gradual adoption: start by treating style issues as warnings, then progressively enforce stricter rules and elevate important security checks to blocking.
- Developer onboarding: document the tools and provide a one-line command or a Makefile / script to run them locally.

4. What tangible improvements did you observe after applying the fixes?

- Readability: added module and function docstrings and clearer logging made the code easier to understand.
- Robustness: input validation and narrowing exception handling reduced the chance of silent failures and unexpected crashes.
- Maintainability: replacing mutable default arguments and avoiding global rebinding makes functions safer to reuse and easier to test.
- Observability: switching to lazy logging formatting and improving log messages gives clearer runtime diagnostics without extra cost.

If you want, I can also add a short GitHub Actions workflow that runs Pylint/Flake8/Bandit on each PR and writes their outputs (`pylint_report.txt`, `flake8_report.txt`, `bandit_report.txt`) to the artifacts for review.
